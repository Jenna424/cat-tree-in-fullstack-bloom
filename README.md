### **_Description_**

##### This app, created for Project 2 of GA's SEIR, enables animal rescue organizations to keep track of cats that are currently under their care and available for fostering or adoption. Adoption coordinators and volunteers can access a list of animal shelters and cats that are found in a particular shelter. Users can add cats to a particular shelter, remove cats from the shelter upon their adoption, and update a shelter's current cat count.

##### Navigate to website-goes-here and start viewing shelters and cats.
